## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) (HITSZ)</a> since Mar. 2024, under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://miaozhang0525.github.io/" target="_blank"> Miao Zhang</a>. And I received my banchelor's degree in Jun. 2020 and masters' degree under the supervision of Prof.<a href="http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangyunzhou/zh_CN" target="_blank"> Yunzhou Zhang</a> in Jun. 2023 both at Northeastern University (Shenyang, China). Currently my research focuses on **Model Compression**, especially for **Large Language Models**.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.
