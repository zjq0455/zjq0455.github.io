working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QtyFQVYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Thaddeus Tarpey</a>. My research involves developing statistical models that cater to high-dimensional complex data, such as functional and imaging data. This endeavor confronts two main challenges: First, how to define a metric with self-consistent property to cluster a population into subgroups, based on rich and complex tensor data for each individual. Second, how to develop a semi-supervised clustering algorithm, directed by a specific label, to accurately identify subgroups that align closely with a target subgroup of interest.

In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Research Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Cornell University</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://www.idiaz.xyz" target = "_blank"> Iván Díaz</a>.
<!-- and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>.  -->

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.
